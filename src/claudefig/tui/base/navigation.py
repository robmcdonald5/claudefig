"""Base classes for navigable panels and screens with consistent navigation bindings.

This module provides base classes that establish standard navigation patterns
across the TUI. Panels and screens can inherit from these bases and selectively
override behavior while maintaining consistent tooltip descriptions and key bindings.

Architecture:
    - BaseNavigablePanel: Standard 4-directional navigation for panels
    - BaseHorizontalNavigablePanel: Horizontal-only navigation (up/down disabled)
    - BaseScreen: Standard navigation for full screens with ScrollNavigationMixin

Usage:
    # Standard panel navigation
    class MyPanel(BaseNavigablePanel):
        # Inherits all navigation - just works!
        pass

    # Custom panel navigation
    class GridPanel(BaseNavigablePanel):
        # Override specific actions for custom behavior
        def action_navigate_up(self) -> None:
            self._custom_grid_navigation(-1, 0)

    # Horizontal-only panel navigation
    class ButtonRowPanel(BaseHorizontalNavigablePanel):
        # Up/down automatically disabled and hidden
        pass

    # Standard screen navigation
    class MyScreen(BaseScreen):
        # Inherits navigation with ScrollNavigationMixin support
        pass

    """Base class for panels with standard 4-directional navigation.

    Provides consistent navigation bindings and tooltip descriptions across

    customize navigation behavior while keeping consistent descriptions.

    Default Behavior:
        - Up/Down: Navigate vertically through focus chain
        - Left/Right: Navigate horizontally through focus chain

    Customization:

    # (like ConfigPanel's 2D grid) should implement these methods explicitly.

class BaseScreen(Screen, BackButtonMixin, ScrollNavigationMixin):
    """Base class for full screens with standard navigation and scroll support.

    Provides consistent navigation bindings for all detail screens with
    ScrollNavigationMixin support for smart vertical/horizontal navigation.
    All screens automatically get back button functionality via BackButtonMixin.

    Features:
        - Escape/Backspace: Pop screen (go back)
        - Up/Down: Navigate vertically with smart scrolling (no wrap)
        - Left/Right: Navigate horizontally within button groups
        - ScrollNavigationMixin: Auto-scroll focused widgets into view
        - BackButtonMixin: Standard back button behavior

    Default Behavior:
        - escape/backspace call action_pop_screen() which dismisses the screen
        - Navigation uses ScrollNavigationMixin's focus_previous/next/left/right
        - Consistent "Navigate Up/Down/Left/Right" tooltip descriptions

    Customization:
        Override action_pop_screen() for custom back behavior:

        class CustomScreen(BaseScreen):
